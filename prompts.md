## Prompt 1
I need help creating an interactive slideshow with dot navigation 
for a personal portfolio website. The slideshow should display images 
and descriptions for different projects. Can you assist me in generating 
the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code? 

Here are the specific elements and functionality to incorporate:
* Create a flexible HTML container for each project slide, 
  ensuring each image proportionally resizes within its container.
* Add three projects to the slider, including images, headings,
  and descriptions.
* Overlay the headings and descriptions fully above the images,
  using a partially transparent background to ensure readability
  without obscuring the image.
* Implement a dot navigation using HTML and CSS. Each dot should
  represent a project and visually indicate the active slide.
* Allow users to switch between slides using the dot navigation.
* Remember to add a fade transition between each slide when
  users navigate between the slides.

Please generate the image slider code files with detailed comments
explaining each part's functionality.

## Prompt 2
Please update the JavaScript code to automatically switch to the next slide every 5 seconds.
